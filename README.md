1.**Introduction :** <br>
   The Blockchain-Based Loyalty and Rewards Program utilizes the power of blockchain technology to provide a secure and transparent platform for E-commerce platforms, 
   brands, sellers, and customers to participate in a seamless loyalty and rewards ecosystem. By employing fungible tokens on the blockchain, we ensure traceability, 
   security, and user empowerment.

2.**Key Features :** <br>
   (a) Generation of Fungible Tokens: Loyalty points are represented as fungible tokens on the blockchain, earned by users through various actions.<br>
   (b) Transparent Tokenomics: Clear value and issuance rules for fungible tokens, providing transparency to brands and partners.<br>
   (c) Instant Account Settlement: Simplified and instant settlements of fungible tokens between brands, sellers, and E-commerce platforms recorded on-chain.<br>
   (d) Earning Mechanism: Clearly defined rules for users to earn fungible tokens based on purchases, referrals, and social media interactions.<br>
   (e) Issuing by Partners: Platform partners and sellers can issue fungible tokens to loyal customers, enhancing user engagement.<br>
   (f) Reward Redemption: Customers can redeem rewards using their fungible tokens, all recorded on the blockchain.<br>
   (g) On-Chain Transactions: All transactions related to fungible tokens are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing double-spending.<br>
   (h) User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface for users to manage loyalty points, view available rewards, and track their progress.<br>

3. **Tokenomics :** <br>
   
       The value and issuance of fungible tokens are defined as follows:

       (a) Token Value: 1 Fungible Token = X units of value.
       (b) Total Issued Tokens: Y tokens will be issued initially.
       (c) Daily Issuance: Z tokens will be issued daily to ensure a controlled supply.

4. **Account Settlement :** <br>

   Settlement of fungible tokens between brands, sellers, and E-commerce platforms is handled instantaneously on the blockchain. This ensures quick and transparent 
   transactions without intermediaries.

5. **Earning Fungible Tokens :** <br>

       Users can earn fungible tokens through the following actions:

       (a) Purchases: Earn X tokens for every $ spent.
       (b) Referrals: Earn Y tokens for every successful referral.
       (c) Social Media Interactions: Earn Z tokens for sharing and engaging on social media.

6. **Issuing Fungible Tokens :** <br>
    Platform partners and sellers can issue fungible tokens to reward loyal customers, fostering customer loyalty and engagement.

7. **Redeeming Rewards :** <br>
    Customers can use their fungible tokens to redeem rewards offered by brands and partners. Each redemption is recorded on the blockchain, preventing any fraudulent 
    activity.

8. **Transactions and Transparency :** <br>
    All transactions involving fungible tokens are recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency, traceability, and security.

9. **User-Friendly Interface :** <br>

       A user-friendly interface allows customers to:

       (a) View earned loyalty points (fungible tokens).
       (b) Check their earning history and transactions.
       (c) Browse available rewards and track progress toward redemption.

10. **Bonus Features :** <br>

        (a) GUI-Based Tool: A user-friendly tool that doesn't require blockchain programming knowledge, catering to brands, retailers, and customers.
        (b) Decaying Nature of Tokens: Implement a decaying mechanism for fungible tokens in the customer's wallet after a defined period.


11. **Getting Started :** <br>

        To run and deploy the solution locally, follow these steps:<br>

        (a) Clone this repository: git clone : https://github.com/AbhinavISM/funglible_rewards . <br>
        (b) WebPrototype :  https://fungible-rewards.web.app/#/
